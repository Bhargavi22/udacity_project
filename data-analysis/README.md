## **Analysis to compare covid incident rate with mobility**
</br>

---
### **Below Geographic chart shows the incident rate (total_confired_cases/population)% by the states in the US.** ###

#### According to the map shown below, states like North Dakota (ND), South Dakota (SD), Wisconson (WI) have a higher incident rate compared to other states. This means higher number of people got infected to covid with respect to the overall state population.

#### Normally the attention is on the states with highest number of cases, but this diagram tells a different story of less talked about states.

### **Below are the 5 states from the top and 5 states from the bottom, based on incident rate** ###
#### Clearly the states with lower incident rate have done a better job in controlling covid.

### **One of the many measures that could prevent spreading of the virus is reduced mobility** ###
#### Below table shows average mobility percentage change from baseline for North Dakota (ND) and District of Columbia (DC).
![covid_response_ND_VS_DC](./covid_response_ND_VS_DC.png)

#### * Both the states have approximately the same population, but there is a huge difference in incident rate.
#### * For ND it is 10.2% where as for DC it is only 3%

#### * The percentage change in mobility justifies why that is the case.
#### * More people were moving around in ND than in DC.

#### * Also, Residential Percent Change From Baseline for DC is higher than ND, which means more people were staying home in the DC area.

#### * Similarly, below diagram shows the park percentage from baseline was higher in states with higher covid incident rate
